//! The RPC flash route as a sans-io state machine (finding 75, "The RPC route"). No I/O and no clock: a driver (the command line, the
//! Tauri app and the browser through `wasm.rs`) sends what `next` returns, feeds each reply to `on_reply`, and calls `on_timeout` when
//! no reply came in time.
//!
//! The route: `OsUpgradeStart (0x50)`, `OsUpgradeWrite (0x51)` in order, then `OsUpgradeEnd (0x52)`. The device checks the whole image
//! when the last Write arrives and answers status 1. It never asks "UPGRADE OS NOW?" on this route: the host asks, and its answer is
//! End with commit 1 (flash) or 0 (leave the flash untouched).
//!
//! Choices (host side):
//! - One request in flight. The device answers every Write, so the next one goes out only after the reply.
//! - CRC mismatch (status 2): the same chunk is sent again, at most `CRC_RETRIES` times, then the run fails.
//! - No reply in time, status 3, a wrong byte count or a wrong status: the run fails and End with commit 0 is sent. A Write is not sent
//!   again after a timeout. The emulator ignores a Write below the bytes it has taken, so a resend would be safe there, but that was not
//!   seen on a real device and the last Write runs the 2 s validation; a failed run costs only a new start (nothing is flashed).
//! - After End with commit 1 nothing can be cancelled any more.
