//! The machine budget: how many DSP instructions per block a module may take on a device, and the selection rule that the broker, the packer
//! and the workbench share (docs/plans/profiling.md section 6, docs/plans/sdk.md section 9).
//!
//! The unit is **instructions** (SHARC+ instructions the emulator counts, not hardware cycles) until the device calibration (profiling item
//! P9). A block is `dsp_clock_hz / dsp_blocks_per_second` cycles. The stock firmware with a held note takes `stock_busy` instructions of it.
//! A patched image stays under [`DEFAULT_BUDGET_PCT`] of the block, with instructions projected to cycles by the "high" factor of
//! `devices/cycle-factors.json`; the 15 percent left over are the safety margin until P9. What is left between the stock load and that limit is
//! the **headroom**.
//!
//! No device number is written here: [`DeviceCost`] is filled from `devices/*.toml` (`[board]`, `[adapter.machine] voices`) and
//! `devices/cycle-factors.json` ([`parse_cycle_factors`]).
