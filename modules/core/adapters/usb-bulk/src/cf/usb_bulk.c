/* core/usb-bulk: a vendor bulk interface (interface 2: EP2 OUT and EP2 IN, 512-byte packets) added to the firmware's USB MIDI mode.
 * Plan: docs/plans/usb-fast.md section 4. Facts: docs/findings/42-usb-transfer-routes.md sections 1 and 4 (static, DT2 1.17 and DN2 1.12).
 *
 * The USB engine is the firmware's and is not patched. Its port table is RAM: entry 2 (USB MIDI) holds the connect and disconnect callbacks and the
 * pointer and length of the configuration descriptor. ub_enable repoints those four words (a 124-byte copy of the stock 101-byte descriptor
 * with interface 2 appended; callbacks of ours that call the stock ones) and re-enumerates through the firmware's own stop and restart pair.
 *
 * RX: a ring of up to RX_MAX slots of RX_BYTES (RX_PAGES 4 KiB pages: the firmware only builds single-page dTDs; ours name all five page pointers, see queue_transfer). Each is queued
 * as one dTD on EP2 OUT. A dTD completes when it is full or when a packet shorter than 512 bytes (a zero-length packet too) ends the transfer: the host
 * sends a zero-length packet after any frame whose length is a multiple of 512 bytes. The completion callback runs in the USB interrupt: it marks the buffer
 * full and queues a free one. With no free buffer nothing is queued, the host gets NAK, and that is the whole flow control. The dTDs come from the firmware's
 * pool (the engine's own EP1 callback does the same from the interrupt); its free callback is wrapped to see the status byte, and a halted or error status
 * drops the transfer. TX: ub_send copies into one of TX_SLOTS slots and queues one dTD on EP2 IN (64-byte packets, see QH_CAPS_IN); the completion frees it.
 *
 * Buffers are accessed through the uncached alias of DDR, so the DMA and the CPU never see stale cache lines; only the receive reads of a module use the
 * cached address, after an invalidate (UB_CACHED_RX). The stock disconnect callback polls
 * ENDPTFLUSH without a bound; ours flushes EP2 first with a bounded poll. Interrupts are masked (SR 0x2700) around every state change, never around a
 * copy: the state is touched by the I/O task, the UI loop tick and the USB interrupt. A refused dTD leaves `need_prime`, retried from the module's calls
 * and from usb_bulk_tick (dkrt_poll_add).
 *
 * There is no take-over: dk_usb_bulk_takeover and dk_usb_bulk_giveback are stubs that return E_STATE (SDK compatibility). Hosts use the OUT-only interface of USB AUDIO/MIDI
 * (core/usb-bulk-audio).
 *
 * Memory: the descriptor is static; the receive and send buffers are one block from the firmware's allocator (buffers_alloc), allocated when the interface can go
 * live and freed after dk_usb_bulk_disable (buffers_free). EP2 stays enabled (ENDPTCTRL2) from the host's connect until the disconnect, whether or not the buffers exist:
 * without them the host gets NAK. usb_bulk_connect always sets the endpoint up and queues the buffers only when they exist; buffers_alloc queues them when the
 * endpoint is up already; buffers_free takes the transfers back (flush, cancel) and frees only when the controller reports EP2 idle.
 *
 * Contexts: usb_bulk_connect and usb_bulk_disconnect are called by the firmware (the USB interrupt, the mode switch); usb_bulk_rx_done, usb_bulk_tx_done
 * and usb_bulk_cancel are the dTD callbacks (interrupt, or the cancel path of the disconnect). The others are for modules (usb_bulk_* of sdk.toml),
 * from the I/O task. */

 * (packages/emulator/machine/src/board.rs page_index), so the emulator's DMA data (written at the alias) reads as zeros at the cached address. Hardware: -DUB_CACHED_RX=1.
 * Rules, all in this file:
 *  1. The CPU never writes a receive buffer through its cached address. Only the USB DMA writes these buffers (enable writes only the descriptor, through the
 *     alias; the receive buffers are never written by the CPU). A dirty line could be written back over DMA data later. The cached address exists only as the
 *     result of rx_cached(), which only ub_take returns, and the module reads it (its parameter is documented read-only).
 *  2. ub_take invalidates the lines of the received bytes after the DMA completed (the completion callback marked the buffer full) and before the
 *     first CPU read. `cpushl dc,(Ax)` pushes a line if modified and invalidates it (CACR[DDPI] = 0, CFPRM CPUSHL p.8-2, MCF5441x RM 6.4.8 Table 6-10). The firmware
 *     writes CACR = 0xa50ce100 once (finding 07-emulator): SPA (bit 14) = 1 so Ax is a physical address and only the line that holds it is touched, IVO = 0,
 *     DDPI = 0. The lines are clean (rule 1), so the push writes nothing. The caches do not snoop DMA (RM 6.1).
 *  3. The cached address is returned only after the invalidate; ub_release takes either address. */
