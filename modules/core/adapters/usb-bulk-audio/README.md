# core/usb-bulk-audio

A vendor bulk OUT interface (interface 5, EP2 OUT, 512-byte packets) in the firmware's USB AUDIO/MIDI configuration (port entry 5), for the usb-fast upload path. No mode switch and no controller
stop: macOS keeps audio and MIDI, and the host sees one more interface. Plan: `docs/plans/usb-fast-audio-bulk.md`; hardware probe result and facts: `docs/findings/123-usb-takeover.md`,
`docs/findings/42-usb-transfer-routes.md` section 4.

- **Hook.** The module hooks the entry of the firmware's USB init (`cf.usb.hook.init`, claim `cf.usb.site.init`; same code at the same address on DT2 1.17 and DN2 1.12). The init runs at boot
  and again from the firmware tick (interrupt context) after a controller reset, so `ua_prepare` is ISR-safe, idempotent and makes no runtime calls. It never stops or restarts the controller.
- **`ua_prepare`.** It checks entry 5 (USB AUDIO/MIDI: length 0x148, a configuration header of 9 bytes, type 2, 5 interfaces; wTotalLength is not checked, the firmware fills it in after the
  hook) and that its static buffer lies in the cached DDR window. If not, `usb_bulk_audio_state` is 2 and nothing is written (USB stays stock). Otherwise it copies the 0x148 descriptor bytes to
  a static buffer, appends interface 5 (vendor class, one endpoint: EP2 OUT, bulk, 512 bytes; EP2 OUT is unused by the stock configuration, EP2 IN stays the audio feedback), sets wTotalLength
  0x0158 and bNumInterfaces 6, and repoints the entry's connect, disconnect, descriptor pointer and length. `usb_bulk_audio_state`: 0 not prepared, 1 prepared, 2 refused.
- **Wrappers.** `ua_connect` (the host's bus reset or SET_CONFIGURATION) runs the stock connect, then `usb_bulk_port5_connect`. `ua_disconnect` calls `usb_bulk_port5_disconnect`, then the stock
  disconnect. Both run in the USB interrupt.
- **Receive side: core/usb-bulk.** `ua_prepare` calls `usb_bulk_port5_attach()` once the entry is ours. In USB AUDIO/MIDI with it, core/usb-bulk treats port 5 as bulk capable, OUT only: the queue
  head caps of EP2 OUT and the receive half of ENDPTCTRL2 (mask 0x0000ffff; the transmit half is the firmware's feedback endpoint) are set at connect, the receive ring runs as in USB MIDI mode, and
  bit `DK_USB_BULK_OUT_ONLY` (0x40) of `usb_bulk_state` is set. `usb_bulk_send` returns E_STATE there. A bus reset drops the dTDs without callbacks: every connect rebuilds the ring. Details:
  the README of core/usb-bulk.
- **Exports** (symbols of this module, called by patchkit's link and by tests): `void ua_prepare(void)`, `void ua_connect(void)`, `void ua_disconnect(void)`, `volatile u32 usb_bulk_audio_state`.
  Used from core/usb-bulk (symbols of that module): `usb_bulk_port5_attach`, `usb_bulk_port5_connect`, `usb_bulk_port5_disconnect`, `usb_alias_delta`, `usb_ddr_base`, `usb_ddr_bytes`.
- **Patch sets.** `device-audio-bulk` (`devices/digitakt-ii.toml`, `devices/digitone-ii.toml`) is the `device` set plus this module.
