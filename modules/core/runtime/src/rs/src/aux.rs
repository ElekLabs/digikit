//! The helper task: one RTOS task that runs one function at a time for a caller that blocks on something else meanwhile. The close's card read-back
//! (`store_writer`, and the +Drive adapter's close hash through `dkrt_aux_run`) reads piece n + 1 from the card, which blocks the I/O task on the card's
//! semaphore, while the helper hashes piece n. The task is created at the first `run`, with a static TCB and stack, and never deleted.
//!
//! One call at a time: `run` answers `E_BUSY` while a run is not yet collected with `wait`, and the caller then does the work itself. The function runs
//! with its own 4 KiB stack: no firmware calls, no waiting. Priority 3, the I/O task's (UI 6, MIDI 7): it never starves, and it runs while the I/O task sleeps.
//!
//! Rules: no `match` on integers, no `core::fmt`, no slice indexing.
