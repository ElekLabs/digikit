//! The real platform under the core: `RealPlatform`, a zero-sized type that implements `dkrt_abi::platform::Platform` over the device object's words
//! (`src/cf/<dev>/device.s`), the assembly helpers (`tramp.s`) and the firmware calls of the `dkfw` crate. This is the only runtime file that names
//! `dkfw` (`mise run check:layers`); it also holds the one gated card write and the free functions the rest of the core calls (`PLATFORM` is the
//! constant behind them).
//!
//! Host tests link no firmware: under `cfg(test)` the methods that read the device object or the firmware answer like a device with no counters
//! (profile of the first device file, no block clock, no MIDI counter). The tests that drive platform behaviour use `FakePlatform` (`fake_platform.rs`)
//! through the generic functions.
