//! Interface B of docs/ARCHITECTURE.md: what the core calls on a service, and only what the service declared.
//!
//! A service implements `Service`. The core keeps one static table of the in-crate services (`gen_services.rs`, written by `patchkit gen`
//! from `[[service]]` and `[records.kinds]` of sdk/sdk.toml) and walks it through `ServiceTable`: a row is the service's name, its record
//! kinds and one function pointer per method; no `dyn`, no table in RAM. The core never names a service outside the generated table.
//!
//! What a service declares:
//! - record kinds of the `register` section (the row's `kinds`: kind and length from sdk.toml), and their `check`, `apply` and `remove` (the registry walker calls them);
//! - the DSP section parts it owns: `dsp_check_*`, `dsp_admit`, `dsp_claim`, `dsp_release`, `dsp_clear`, `dsp_row_step`
//!   (the DSP loader in `dsp/mod.rs` keeps the area, the row table and the state machine);
//! - capacity counts (`cap`, per capacity kind), the module behind a fault site (`attribute`), the guard's state of a machine type (`guard_state`);
//! - the declarations of a module's DSP rows (`has_voice`, `declare_voice`, `declare_fx`) and `on_loaded`.
