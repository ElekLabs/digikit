//! The runtime's event log (docs/findings/46-digikit-debug.md). Every call site calls `ev`. An event is 32 bytes: a sequence number (from 1; 0 is no
//! event), the firmware's block counter (1500 per second) as the time, a kind (`dkrt_sdk::logk`), flags (bit 0: an error; bits 1 to 3: the level; bits
//! 8 to 15: the source module) and five argument words.
//!
//! The runtime keeps a small ring (`RING` events) for the crash record's tail and for a debug module that loads later: every event until the first UI
//! frame, then boot and error events. A replay to a new sink keeps the runtime's sequence numbers, so a gap (the ring overflowed) shows. One
//! sink pointer (`dk_debug_log_sink_set`, an import of the modules) receives every event before any filter: `digikit/debug` holds the long ring, the level
//! filter and the host commands. Without a sink the other events are dropped (one pointer test).
//!
//! The sink channels (`dk_sink_set`, runtime-and-services 5.11) are the generic form of that mechanism: channel `SINK_LOG` receives the same events as the
//! pointer above, channel `SINK_SPAN` receives `(owner, cycles)` records (`Span`) from `span_emit`. Each channel has one owner, the module whose code set it;
//! a second owner is refused with `E_BUSY`. The channel is cleared after its owner's `fini` (`release_sinks`). With no sink set a producer pays one test.
//!
//! Appends mask interrupts for a few instructions: the UI task, the MIDI task and the crash handler all append.
