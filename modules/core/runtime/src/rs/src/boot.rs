//! Boot-time loading (docs/plans/digikit-runtime.md decision 9, Phase 6; finding 37).
//!
//! `dkrt_boot` runs once per boot from the main-OS task, just before the MainScreenView constructor (`src/cf/tramp.s`
//! `dkrt_boot_hook`): the block read, the DSP and the block-frame interrupt work there and the machine view is not built yet.
//! It reads the selection record, decides about safe mode, raises the boot counter, and loads the selected modules in order
//! through the same loader as ever (a module that fails is skipped and reported; the others load). DSP code is sent with
//! `dl_send` and awaited by polling the state machine here (bounded); what has not finished when the bound is reached continues
//! in the UI-loop hook as before. The boot counter is cleared by `ui_pass` once the session has been stable: `STABLE_BLOCKS` DSP blocks (30 s)
//! after the first UI-loop pass (at the first pass itself in a safe boot, where no module runs). A boot that dies before then counts as bad.
//!
//! The record is the only thing the runtime writes to the card here, and only to its two sectors (`store::Layout::sel_a`/`sel_b`), through
//! `block_write`, which refuses a write when the card's area is not ours (`card.rs`): then the boot counter is not raised either.
