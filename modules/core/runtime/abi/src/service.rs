//! Interface B of docs/ARCHITECTURE.md: what the core calls on a service, and only what the service declared.
//!
//! A service implements `Service`. The core keeps one static table of the in-crate services (`ServiceTable` over `ServiceRow`s,
//! generated from `[[service]]` of sdk/sdk.toml into `gen_services.rs`): a row is the service's name, the record kinds it owns
//! (kind and length, from `[records.kinds]`) and one function pointer per method; there is no `dyn` and no table in RAM.
//! The core never names a service outside the generated table (docs/plans/runtime-and-services.md R7).
//!
//! What a service declares:
//! - record kinds of the `register` section (`len`), and their `check`, `apply` and `remove` (the registry walker calls them);
//! - the DSP section parts it owns: `dsp_check_*`, `dsp_admit`, `dsp_claim`, `dsp_release`, `dsp_clear`, `dsp_row_step`
//!   (the DSP loader in `dsp/mod.rs` keeps the area, the row table and the state machine);
//! - capacity counts (`caps`), the module behind a fault site (`attribute`), the guard's state of a machine type (`guard_state`);
//! - the declarations of a module's DSP rows (`has_voice`, `declare_voice`, `declare_fx`) and `on_loaded`.
