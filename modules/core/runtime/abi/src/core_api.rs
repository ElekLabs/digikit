//! Interface C of docs/ARCHITECTURE.md: what a service (`src/services/*` of the runtime crate) calls in the core. A service reaches parameter rows, the
//! registry's and the DSP loader's state, the module table, settings, the store, the log, the job queue and the DSP link only through `CoreApi`, or through the
//! pure types of this crate.
//!
//! `RealCore` (runtime crate) is a zero-sized type that delegates to the core functions, so a call through it costs what the direct call cost. A function
//! that a host test must drive takes a generic `C: CoreApi` (no `dyn`: the runtime has no allocator and no vtables); everything else calls the `REAL_CORE`
//! constant. `FakeCore` (host tests of the runtime crate) records the calls in order.
//!
//! The DSP link belongs to the core (`link.rs` of the runtime crate): a service sets live values with `link_set` and sends owned streams with
//! `link_submit` (types in `crate::link`). It never asks whether the link is busy.
//!
//! Platform facts (the device profile, the interrupt mask) are not here: they belong to `platform::Platform`. A service names them through `crate::core_api::PLATFORM`.
