//! The DSP link API: the types a writer uses (docs/plans/runtime-and-services.md, R6). The core owns the link (`link.rs` of the runtime crate); a
//! service reaches it through `CoreApi::link_*`.
//!
//! Two kinds of writes:
//! - **Live values** (effect knobs, send amounts): `link_set(slot, value)`. The core keeps the newest value of each slot with a version and a dirty bit and
//!   sends what is not confirmed. A fast knob turn sends the last value only; a write that failed is sent again.
//! - **Streams** with an owner: `link_submit(owner, stream)` returns a `Ticket`, and `link_result(ticket)` gives the result of that request to its owner
//!   only. `Bulk` is a run of bytes (a buffer the caller keeps valid until the result, or bytes the queue owns); `Sequence` is a list of word writes in
//!   order (the type or pc word last), with a rollback on failure.
//!
//! The windows of `core/dsp-link`: 0 is the area (byte addresses), 1 the voice rows, 2 the effect rows (word offsets). The field is 2 bits wide; window 3 is
//! reserved (the profiler's statistics, P8) and no writer may use it.
