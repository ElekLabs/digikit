//! dkrt-abi: the interfaces of the digikit runtime (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "Three interfaces") and the pure types and constants they share.
//!
//! - `core_api`: interface C, `CoreApi`: what a service calls in the core (parameter rows, the module table, settings, the log, jobs, the DSP link).
//! - `service`: interface B, `Service` and `ServiceList`: what the core calls on a service, with the context types of those calls.
//! - `dsp`, `registry`, `mem`: types, constants and helpers with no state. The core owns the objects (`DKRT_DSP`, `DKRT_REG`) and hands them out through `CoreApi`.
//!
//! This crate never depends on the runtime crate: a function that needs the core's state belongs to `CoreApi`, so the dependency arrows between the core and the
//! services point at this crate and nowhere else. `#![no_std]`; no allocation, no vtables.
